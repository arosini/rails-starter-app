    - rubycritic app features (No smells, all classes green [A or B])
    - brakeman (No errors/warnings)

  Tests:
    - rake test TESTOPTS='--profile' (No failures/errors, 100% code coverage, try to make tests as fast as possible)
    - cucumber --format usage (No failures, no unused steps, try to make scenarios as short as possible)

Manual tests for every page on Desktop/Android Phone/iPhone/Android Tablet/iPad in Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera:
