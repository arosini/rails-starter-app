TO DO:
- Finish cucumber tests (testing to do)
- Documenation. Make sure to document future development process (CI steps).
- Check tests. Make sure everything is explictly unit tested (not tested as a by-product of other tests), and all features have cucumber tests.
- Work on future features

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Any 'TO_REMOVE' comments
 - Users controller gets a B in rubycritic
 - Tests (especially MiniTest) are amatuer hour -- attempt refactor, research, get help, do something.
   - Make sure everything is explicltly tested
   - Minimize assertions/time per test
   - Make sure all major actions in the app are covered by cucumber tests.

POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES:
  - Date search for users index
  - Add multiple users (See railscast on nested forms).
  - Retain search/advanced-search form values on users index
  - Btn group elipses (when too many are selected to fit in button width)
  - Change routes to not display key/model information -- https://github.com/namick/obfuscate_id
  - Javascript code analyzer
  - Metrics on routes, sign ups, etc... find some gems
  - Voice activated UI
  - Translate to another language

TESTING TO DO:
  - Users cucumber
  - Roles cucumber

DOCUMENTATION TO DO:
  - Design a documentation system
  - Use rdoc?
  - Start up the wiki
  - Document everything!
