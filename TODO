TO DO:
- Finish cucumber tests (testing to do)
- Step definiton edit: Fill in field by label, change password edit steps
- Make custom user_path (my_profile_path if current_user, otherwise user_path(@user))
- Use more capybara magic (https://gist.github.com/zhengjia/428105) / http://www.elabs.se/blog/51-simple-tricks-to-clean-up-your-capybara-tests
- Check tests. Make sure everything is explictly unit tested (not tested as a by-product of other tests), and all features have cucumber tests.
- Make sure locales are all used, no repitition
- Fix up rubycritic results
- Documentation. Make sure to document future development process (CI steps).
- Change vendor assets to CDN
- Add output to rake db:seed
- Squash to V1.0
- Work on future features

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Any 'TO_REMOVE' comments
 - Users controller gets a B in rubycritic
 - Tests (especially MiniTest) are amatuer hour -- attempt refactor, research, get help, do something.
   - Make sure everything is explicltly tested
   - Minimize assertions/time per test
   - Make sure all major actions in the app are covered by cucumber tests.

POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES:

  - Date search for users index
  - Add multiple users (See railscast on nested forms).
  - Retain search/advanced-search form values on users index
  - Btn group elipses (when too many are selected to fit in button width)
  - Change routes to not display key/model information -- https://github.com/namick/obfuscate_id
  - Javascript code analyzer
  - Metrics on routes, sign ups, etc... find some gems
  - Voice activated UI
  - Translate to another language

TESTING TO DO:
  - Users advanced search cucumber
  - Roles cucumber

DOCUMENTATION TO DO:
  - Design a documentation system
